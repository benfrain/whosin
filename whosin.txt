## v1

- input box allows you to add names [fixed top/bottom] [x]
- Each name can be set to in or out [x]
- Tool splits those that are in into teams [default to splitting to 2]
- swiping a name gives option to delete it []
- tool tray maybe (that could house the split, download, upload, delete-all)
- localStorage [x]
- show currentCount of whosin [x]
- If there are no people 'in' hide the splitter [x]

## v2
- Use vCard Parser to include contact info such as phone/email
- split multiplier [tools let's you set divider]
- save and import JSON [x]
- service worker
- animations for add/remove
- pay mode (a toggle in settings allows 'in' users to have an additional toggle to show they have paid)

## v3 
- multiple lists/teams
- undo for delete (store person object in a trash area which can be re-instated from tools)

## data
function whoIsIn() {
    this.currentCount = 0;
    this.whoisin = [];
    this.showingInput = false;
    this.showingTool = false;
    this.observers = [];
}

### example person data

{
    name:"Ben",

    contactEmail: null,
    paid: false,

}

## listeners

click add icon => `inputShow`
swipe down anywhere => `inputShow`


#### Reasons
Use Yarn instead of NPM
Use ES2015/TypeScript (for easy imports)
Use webpack
Learn service workers
Progressive web app
Design something





### Notes
file type input is VERY difficult to style so wrapped this in a label element, hid the input and styled the label instead

- If a user has a split set, I would expect each subsequent person added to get automatically split (e.g. if a two way split of 9 people, first 4 one team, last 5 the other).
- Need to store the team split in local storage too. That way, when a user loads in their data, the split will be correct also.

- need a set of SVG defs that can be loaded in at the outset in the shell

- thought, maybe we need a 'shuffle/mix' button under the names when we have a team split going on. Don't think that needs to animate (yet) but maybe the movement function can be re factored such that it takes an element and destination sort order and it can just sort the movement out. That should then work on a loop of elements and destinations and even in reverse (for removing).

### Need to sort the ordering
- When a person is added, they need to go to the beginning.
- When a person is removed, they need to be 'popped' and the subsequent items re-ordered (incidentally, we
