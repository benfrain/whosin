A journey into JavaScript competency

I've never made a todo app. I don't like frameworks.

I do however want to try my hand at building something simple and 'app like'

## More reasons

- Use Yarn instead of NPM
- Use ES2015/TypeScript (for easy imports)
- Use webpack
- Learn service workers
- Progressive web app (PWA and test against Lighthouse)
- Design something simple
